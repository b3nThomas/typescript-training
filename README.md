# typescript-training

Project for practicing TypeScript

## Usage

This project uses `ts-node` which is wrapped under `yarn start`.

To run a `.ts` file once:

```shell
yarn start path/to/file # .ts is not required
```

To run a `.ts` file with automatic reloads:

```shell
yarn watch path/to/file
```
